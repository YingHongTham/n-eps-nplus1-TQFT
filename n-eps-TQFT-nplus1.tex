\title{Upgrading an $(n+\veps)$-TQFT to an extended $(n+1)$-TQFT}
\author{Ying Hong Tham}
\maketitle


In this note, we show that one can promote an
$(n+\veps)$-TQFT to an extended $(n+1)$-TQFT
by only specifying the value associated to
the $(n+1)$-disk $Z(\disk{n+1}) \in Z(S^n)$.

Suppose we are given an $(n+\veps)$-TQFT $Z$,
that is,
it assigns a category $Z(N)$ to a closed $(n-1)$-manifold $N$,
and a functor $Z(M):Z(N) \to Z(N')$ to an $n$-dimensional
cobordisms $M:N\to N'$ between $(n-1)$-manifolds.

TODO perhaps comment on requirements on $Z$,
e.g. a natural isom for $M \simeq M'$,
especially for $Z(M' \circ M) \simeq Z(M') \circ Z(M)$
that is consistent.
Or say, at this point, no assumption on existence of
adjointness of functors $Z(M) \dashv Z(\ov{M})$.

The empty $k$-manifold is denoted by $\empt{k}$.
Composition of cobordisms is written from right to left,
so composition of $M: N \to N'$ and $M' : N' \to N''$
is denoted by $M' \circ M: N \to N''$.

2-Cob denotes the bicategory with
closed $(n-1)$-manifolds as objects,
$n$-dimensional cobordisms as 1-morphisms,
and $(n+1)$-dimensional relative cobordisms as 2-morphisms.

\begin{proposition}
\label{p:extend-uniqueness}
Consider functors
$Z(\disk{n}) : Z(\empt{n-1}) \rightleftharpoons
	Z(\sphr{n-1}) : Z(\ov{\disk{n}})$.

Let $\eta_0: Z(\empt{n}) \Rightarrow
	Z(\sphr{n} = \ov{\disk{n}} \circ \disk{n})
	: Z(\empt{n-1}) \to Z(\empt{n-1})$
be a natural transformation,
and suppose it is the unit to an adjunction
$Z(\disk{n}) \dashv Z(\ov{\disk{n}})$.

Then if $Z',Z''$ are extended $(n+1)$-TQFTs
such that $Z',Z''$ agree with $Z$ on $(n-1)$- and $n$-manifolds,
and $Z'(\disk{n+1}) = Z''(\disk{n+1}) = \eta_0$,
then $Z' \cong Z''$.
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
From the topology section below,
we know that a 2-morphism of 2-Cob that realizes
the attachment of an $(n+1)$-dim $(k+1)$-handle,$0 \leq k \leq n$,
is determined by some counit $\veps_k$
of an adjunction,
whose corresponding unit can be built from handles
of index at most $k$,
and thus, the value of extensions $Z'$ of $Z$ on 2-morphisms
is completely determined by its value on the
$(n+1)$-dim 0-handle, which is exactly $\eta_0$.
\end{proof}



\section{Topology}

\subsection{Adjunctions from topology}
\label{s:topology-adjunctions}

For the purposes of the proof of the proposition above,
only the first simple example from this section is needed,
the reader may then skip to \secref{s:handles-from-adjunctions}.

In 2-Cob,
%In the 2-category with closed $(n-1)$-manifolds as objects,
%$n$-dimensional cobordisms as 1-morphisms,
%and $(n+1)$-dimensional relative cobordisms as 2-morphisms,
the $n$-dimensional cobordisms
$M: N \rightleftharpoons N' : \ov{M}$
form an adjunction.

Let us first consider a simple case,
which is the main setting in \prpref{p:extend-uniqueness}.
Consider $n$-dim cobordisms
$\disk{n}: \empt{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1}: \ov{\disk{n}}$.
This can be promoted to an adjunction
$\disk{n} \dashv \ov{\disk{n}}$
with the following unit and counit 2-morphisms:
the unit is given by the $(n+1)$-disk
$\disk{n+1}: \empt{n} \Rightarrow
	(\ov{\disk{n}} \circ \disk{n}) = \sphr{n}$,
and the counit is given by the $(n+1)$-disk which,
as a manifold with corner $\sphr{0} \times \sphr{n-1}$,
is a 2-morphism
$\disk{n+1} = I \times \disk{n}: \disk{n} \circ \ov{\disk{n}}
	\Rightarrow I \times \sphr{n-1} = \id_{\sphr{n-1}}$.
This is easily checked to be an adjunction,
the unit is an $(n+1)$-dimensional 0-handle,
and the counit is attaching an $(n+1)$-dimensional 1-handle
to $\disk{n} \sqcup \ov{\disk{n}}$
(see \figref{f:disk-adjunction} for $n=1$ case).

relative cobordism goes up
(stolen from \cite{SPries},

\label{f:disk-adjunction}
\end{figure}


Now consider $M: N \rightleftharpoons N': \ov{M}$,
where $M$ is an elementary cobordism of index $k$,
i.e. it is obtained from $N \times I$
by attaching a $k$-handle.
Then $\ov{M}$ is the dual elementary cobordism
which is of index $n-k$.
[See \figref{f:dual-handle}]

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{diagram-dual-handle.jpg}
\caption{$M:N \to N'$ is an elementary cobordism
of index $k$; it is built from attaching a disk $\disk{n}$
to $N \times I$,
with attaching region $\del \disk{k} \times \disk{n-k}$.
It can also be built from the other direction,
by attaching a disk $\disk{n}$
to $N' \times I$,
with attaching region $\disk{k} \times \del \disk{n-k}$.
Thus, turning it upside-down, i.e.
treated as a cobordism $\ov{M}: N' \to N$,
it is an elementary cobordism of index $(n-k)$.
}
\label{f:dual-handle}
\end{figure}

[See \figref{f:elementary-cobord-counit-unit}]
We construct the counit
$\veps: M \circ \ov{M} \Rightarrow \id_{N'} : N' \to N'$
by attaching an
$(n+1)$-dimensional $(k+1)$-handle to $M \cup_{N'} \ov{M}$,
with attaching region being essentially the
$k$-handle in $M$ plus the $(n-k)$-handle in $\ov{M}$;
the attaching sphere is the union of the core of the
$k$-handle in $M$
with the co-core of the $(n-k)$-handle in $\ov{M}$.
Similarly,
we construct the unit
$\eta: \id_N \Rightarrow M \circ \ov{M} : N \to N$
by attaching an
$(n+1)$-dimensional $k$-handle to $\id_N = N \times I$;
the attaching region for this $(n+1)$-dim $k$-handle
is
$($the attaching region for the $n$-dim $k$-handle that defines
$M) \times I$.
The snake equations
$\id_M = (\veps \circ M) \cdot (M \circ \eta):
M \Rightarrow M \circ \ov{M} \circ M \Rightarrow M$
and
$\id_{\ov{M}} = (\ov{M} \circ \eta) \cdot (\eta \circ \ov{M}):
\ov{M} \Rightarrow \ov{M} \circ M \circ \ov{M} \Rightarrow \ov{M}$
follow from the fact that
these $(n+1)$-dim handles form a cancelling pair
in both cases.

Here we have $M \dashv \ov{M}$,
but we may very well have $\ov{M} \dashv M$;
the counit $\veps': \ov{M} \circ M \Rightarrow \id_N$
is an $(n+1)$-dim elementary cobordism
of index $(n-k+1)$.
It is interesting to note that
this counit is the dual cobordism to the unit
$\eta: \id_N \Rightarrow \ov{M} \circ M$
previously described.

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{diagram-counit-unit-elementary-cobord.jpg}
\caption{Counit (top) and unit (bottom) for adjunction
$M: N \rightleftharpoons N': \ov{M}$,
where $M$ is an elementary cobordism of index $k$.
Note the way $N$ is drawn here looks like $N'$
in \figref{f:dual-handle} and vice versa
(by accident, sorry for minor confusion)}
\label{f:elementary-cobord-counit-unit}
\end{figure}



In general, we may consider the pair of $n$-dim cobordisms
$M : N \rightleftharpoons N': \ov{M}$.
By presenting $M$ as a composition of elementary cobordisms,
we may compose the adjunctions constructed
for each of these elementary cobordisms as above,
and obtain an adjunction $M \dashv \ov{M}$.



\begin{remark}
In \cite{Yprod},
we considered this construction
without realizing their connection to these adjunctions;
there we consider the more general case where
$N,N'$ may have (possibly different) boundary, and
$M: N \to N'$ is a relative cobordism
(with the boundary cobordism that is
not necessarily the identity cobordism).
\end{remark}


\subsection{Producing $(n+1)$-dim $k$-handles
from some adjunctions}
\label{s:handles-from-adjunctions}

Throughout this section, $0 \leq k < n$.

We show how to construct the $(n+1)$-dim $(k+1)$-handle
from the counit $\veps_k$ of the adjunction
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} : \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$
and the unit $\eta_0$ of the adjunction
$\disk{n} : \empt{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1}: \ov{\disk{n}}$.
(The 0-handle is already given by $\eta_0$,
while the $(n+1)$-handle is the counit to the adjunction
$\ov{\disk{n}} : \sphr{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\empt{n-1}: \disk{n}$;
we say a few more words about this at the end of this section.)


The process of attaching a $(k+1)$-handle to an $(n+1)$-manifold
can be implemented as postcomposing by a 2-morphism.
More precisely, given an $(n+1)$-manifold $W$
presented as a 2-morphism $W: M \Rightarrow M' : N \to N'$,
and an attaching region $\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}$ in $M'$,
the $(n+1)$-manifold $W'$ obtained from
attaching a $(k+1)$-handle along the specified attaching region
may be considered as a 2-morphism
$W': M \Rightarrow M'': N \to N'$,
where $M''$ is obtain from $M'$ by performing surgery
along the attaching region
(cutting it out and gluing in $\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$);
then $W' = \omega_{k+1} \cdot W$,
where $\omega_{k+1}$ is a 2-morphism that we will describe below.


Our 2-morphism $\omega_{k+1}$ is of the form
$\omega_{k+1}: \sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}
	\Rightarrow \disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1} :
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} \to \empt{n-1}$.
Since this is unchanged as $W$ varies,
we clearly need to make some arrangements
in order to use $\omega_{k+1}$.
More specifically,
we need to present $M'$ as a composition
\[
(\id_{N'} \sqcup \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}})
\circ (M \backslash \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}) :
N \to N' \sqcup \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k+1} \to N'
\]
which is always possible by basic Morse theory.
So we have
($M^\circ := M \backslash \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$):

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (-2,0) {$W' = $};
% objects
\node (a) at (0,0) {$N$};
\node (b) at (4,0) {$N' \sqcup \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k+1}$};
\node (c) at (8,0) {$N' \sqcup \empt{n-1}$};
% 1-morph
\draw[->] (a) -- (b)
	node[pos=0.5,below] {\footnotesize $M^\circ$};
\draw[->] (b) -- (c)
	node[pos=0.5,below]
	{\footnotesize $\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$};
\draw[->] (b) .. controls +(-60:2cm) and +(-120:2cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,below]
	{\footnotesize $\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}$};
\draw[->] (a) .. controls +(60:3cm) and +(120:3cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $M$};
\draw[->] (a) .. controls +(30:2cm) and +(150:2cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $M'$};
% 2-morph
\draw[-{Implies},double] (4,0.6) -- (4,0.3)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\simeq$};
\draw[-{Implies},double] (6,-0.6) -- (6,-1.2)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\omega_{k+1}$};
\end{tikzpicture}


Now let us describe how to construct $\omega_{k+1}$
out of $\veps_k$ and $\eta_0$,
which are, as a reminder,
the counit and unit of the adjunctions
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} : \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$
and
$\disk{n} : \empt{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1}: \ov{\disk{n}}$,
respectively.

We may consider $\sphr{n}: \empt{n-1} \to \empt{n-1}$
as the composition $\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}
\circ \sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} :
\empt{n-1} \to \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} \to \empt{n-1}$.

Then $\omega_{k+1}$ is given by the composition of 2-morphisms
\[
\omega_{k+1} = (\id_{\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}}
		\circ \veps_k)
	\cdot (\id_{\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}} \circ \eta_0)
\]

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (-2,0) {$\omega_{k+1} = $};
% objects
\node (a) at (0,0) {$\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$};
\node (b) at (4,0) {$\empt{n-1}$};
\node (c) at (8,0) {$\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$};
\node (d) at (12,0) {$\empt{n-1}$};
% 1-morph
\draw[->] (a) -- (b)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$};
\draw[->] (b) -- (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}$};
\draw[->] (c) -- (d)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}$};
\draw[->] (b) .. controls +(60:3cm) and +(120:3cm) .. (d)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\empt{n}$};
\draw[->] (a) .. controls +(-60:3cm) and +(-120:3cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\id_{\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}$};
% 2-morph
\draw[-{Implies},double] (8,1.6) -- (8,0.5)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\eta_0$};
\draw[-{Implies},double] (4,-0.5) -- (4,-1.4)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\veps_k$};
\end{tikzpicture}


A few words on the $(n+1)$-handle,
more generally the adjunction
$\ov{\disk{n}} : \sphr{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\empt{n-1}: \disk{n}$.
The unit is a 2-morphism
$\eta: \id_{\sphr{n-1}} \Rightarrow \disk{n} \circ \ov{\disk{n}}$,
which is clearly an elementary cobordism of index $n$.

A similar phenomenon happens with $\veps_k$,
that is, $\eta_k$, the unit to the adjunction
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} \dashv
	\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$,
to which $\veps_k$ is the counit,
is determined by handles of index at most $k$,
and indeed,
$\eta_k = \sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k+1}:
\empt{n} \Rightarrow \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k}:
\empt{n-1} \to \empt{n-1}$
is built from a 0-handle and a $k$-handle.


Thus, since the counit is uniquely determined by the unit,
the $(n+1)$-dim $k$-handle, for $k > 0$,
is determined by handles of lower index.
This may not be very useful in the topology world,
but on the algebraic side of a TQFT,
this means that everything is determined by the 0-handle.



[It may be helpful to note that the adjunction
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} : \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$
is simply $\sphr{k}$ times
the first example but with $n$ set to $n-k$,
$\disk{n-k} : \empt{n-k} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1-k}: \ov{\disk{n-k}}$.

%e.g. by considering the handle decomposition for
%$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \to
%	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$
