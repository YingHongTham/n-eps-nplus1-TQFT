\frametitle{Conventions}
In relation to a 2-category:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\cC$ (caligraphic font): 2-category;

\item $X,Y,F$ (upper case latin): object of 2-category,
	functor between 2-categories;

\item $f,g$ (lower case latin): 1-morphism;
	we write $\cC(X,Y)$ for the category of morphisms
	from $X$ to $Y$;

\item $\eta,\veps,\delta$ (lower case greek): 2-morphism;
	for a 2-morphism $\alpha: f \Rightarrow g: X \to Y$,
	we may write $\alpha \in \cC(X,Y)(f,g)$
	to indicate its sources and targets,
	or simply $\alpha \in \Hom(f,g)$ if the objects are clear
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

In relation to a 1-category:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C,A$ (upper case latin): category;

\item $a,b,f,g$ (lower case latin): objects in category,
	functor between categories;

\item $\alpha,\beta$ (lower case greek): morphism in category
\end{itemize}

We also compose morphisms from right to left:
in a 2-category $\cC$,
for $\alpha \in \cC(X,Y)(f,f'),
\beta \in \cC(Y,Z)(g,g'),
\gamma \in \cC(X,Y)(f',f'')$,
we write:

for composition of 1-morphisms,
\[
g \circ f, g \circ f', \ldots : X \to Z
\]
for horizontal composition of 2-morphisms,
\[
\beta \circ \alpha: (g \circ f) \Rightarrow (g' \circ f'):
	X \to Z
\]
for vertical composition of 2-morphisms,
\[
\gamma \cdot \alpha: f \Rightarrow f'' : X \to Y
\]

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conventions}
In general, if $P$ is a property of a 1-category,
we say that a 2-category $\cC$ is \emph{locally $P$}
if every hom-category $\cC(X,Y)$ satisfies $P$.

\pause

By 2-category we always mean a weak 2-category
that is furthermore locally additive over $\kk$.

By 2-functor (sometimes just functor for simplicity)
between 2-categories will always be locally $\kk$-linear.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{separable algebra} $(a,\mu,\eta)$ in a tensor category $C$
is an algebra that admits an $a$-$a$-bimodule section
$\prescript{}{a}a_a \to \prescript{}{a}a \tnsr a_a$
to $\mu$.
\end{definition}

\pause

\begin{definition}
Let $(t, \mu, \eta)$ be a monad on an object $X$
in a 2-category $\cC$.
We say $t$ is \emph{separable} if there is a
$t$-$t$-bimodule section
$t \Rightarrow t \circ t$ to $\mu$.
\end{definition}

\pause

In other words, a separable monad over $X$
is a separable algebra in $\cC(X,X)$.

\frametitle{Idempotent completeness, separable monads, splittings}

\begin{definition}
Let $r \vdash l: X \to Y$ be an adjunction
with unit $\eta: \id_X \Rightarrow rl$
and counit $\veps: lr \Rightarrow \id_Y$.
We say the adjunction $l \dashv r$ is \emph{separable}
if $\veps$ admits a section.
\end{definition}

\pause

Clearly, if an adjunction $l \dashv r$ is separable,
then the monad $rl$ is separable -
the splitting gives
$rl \simeq r(\id_Y)l \Rightarrow r(lr)l \simeq (rl)(rl)$

\pause

\begin{definition}
Let $(t,\mu,\eta)$ be a separable monad on
an object $X \in \cC$.
A \emph{(separable) splitting} of $t$ is a (separable) adjunction
$r \vdash l: X \to Y$
together with an isomorphism
$\psi: rl \simeq t$ as monads on $X$.
\end{definition}

\pause

%Under the right conditions
%(local idempotent completeness of $\cC$),
%splittings are unique:

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness of splitting]
[\cite{DRfusion}, Theorem A.3.1]
\label{p:splitting-unique}
In locally idempotent complete 2-category $\cC$,
separable splitting of monad,
if exists,
is unique up to equivalence.
\end{proposition}

%In particular, this holds true when $\cC$
%is locally semisimple.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Idempotent completeness, 2-category}

\begin{definition}
A 2-category $\cC$ is \emph{idempotent complete}
if every separable monad admits a splitting
and is locally idempotent complete.
\end{definition}

\pause

\begin{definition}[Idempotent completion]
Let $\cC$ be a locally idempotent complete 2-category.
The \emph{idempotent completion of $\cC$},
denoted $\cC^\nabla$, with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Objects: $(X,p)$ separable monad in $\cC$,
\item $\cC^\nabla((X,p),(Y,q)) = \bimod{q}{p}(\cC(X,Y))$
\end{itemize}

There is a natural 2-functor $I: \cC \to \cC^\nabla$
that is fully faithful.

A 2-functor $F: \cC \to \cD$
extends to a 2-functor $F^\nabla: \cC^\nabla \to \cD^\nabla$
that commutes with $I$'s.
\end{definition}

$\cB C$: one object $*$ with endomorphism category
$\cB C(*,*) = C$
(with $x \otimes y = x \circ y$)

\[
(\cB C)^\nabla =
\begin{cases}
	\Obj: \text{ separable algebras in } C

\begin{proposition}
$\cC^\nabla$ is idempotent complete.
Moreover, if $\cC$ is already idempotent complete,
then $I: \cC \simeq \cC^\nabla$ is an equivalence.
\end{proposition}

\pause

As a consequence, if $\cD$ is idempotent complete,
then we have equivalences of 2-categories
\[
\cFun(\cC,\cD) \simeq \cFun(\cC^\nabla,\cD^\nabla)
\simeq \cFun(\cC^\nabla, \cD)

\begin{proposition}[\cite{DRfusion}{Prop 1.3.13}]
\label{p:modC-deloop}
For a multifusion category $C$,
the following 2-functor is an equivalence:
\begin{align*}
\amod{(-)}(C): (\cB C)^\nabla
	& \to
	\ModA{C}
\\
a & \mapsto
	\amod{a}(C)
\\
\prescript{}{b}m_a & \mapsto
	m \tnsr_a -
\\
\vphi & \mapsto
\vphi \tnsr_a -
\end{align*}
\end{proposition}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Idempotent completeness, 2-category}

\begin{proof}
Essential surjectivity follows from:\\
-\cite{Ostrik}{Theorem 1}: for a finite semisimple right module
category over multifusion $C$, there exists a semisimple algebra
$a$ in $C$ such that $M \simeq \amod{a}(C)$
as right $C$-module categories; and

\pause
-\cite{DSPSb}{Corollary 2.6.9}: When $C$ is multifusion over
a field of characterisitc 0,
a right $C$-module category $M$ is separable
($\simeq \amod{a}(C)$ for a separable algebra $a$)
if and only if it is semisimple.

\pause

Fully faithfulness follows from \cite{EGNO}{Prop 7.11.1}.
\end{proof}

\pause

This is almost one half of the main result;
one still needs to prove local semisimplicity
and existence of adjoints.
This will follow from more results from \cite{DSPSa},\cite{DSPSb},
which we show later.

\frametitle{Simple objects}

\pause

\begin{proposition}[equivalent notions of simple-ness]
Let $\cC$ be an idempotent complete and
locally finite semisimple 2-category,
and let $X \in \cC$ be a nonzero object.
Then the following notions of $X$ being simple are equivalent:

\pause

(1) any subobject $i: Y \to X$ of $X$
 is either 0 or an equivalence;

\pause

(2) $X$ cannot be written as a non-trivial direct sum,
	i.e. if $X = \boxplus X_i$,
	then $X_i \simeq 0$ for all but one $i$;

\pause

(3) $\id_X$ is a simple object in $\cC(X,X)$.
\end{proposition}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Simple objects}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
(1) $\Rightarrow$ (2): Contravariant statement
follows from fully faithfulness of
$i_k: A_k \to A_1 \boxplus A_2$.

\pause

(2) $\Rightarrow$ (3): Contravariant statement is
``identity splitting implies object splitting'',
uses idempotent completeness of $\cC$
to split out objects corresponding to summands of $\id_X$
(which are separable monads)
(see \cite{DRfusion}{Prop 1.3.16}).

\pause

(3) $\Rightarrow$ (1): for non-zero fully faithful $r: Y \to X$,
with $\id_X$ simple,
consider the left adjoint $l: X \to Y$,
use fully faithfulness to get a preimage
$\delta : \id_Y \Rightarrow lr$ of
$\eta \circ r: r \Rightarrow rlr$.
%Use simplicity of $\id_X$ to get section of the unit $\eta$.
Show $\delta$ is a section of the counit. Etc.

The only property of $X$ that we used is the fact that
there exists a nonzero 1-morphism from $X$ to every simple
in $\cC$,
and thus any nonzero $X$ will do.
\pause
Taking, say, $X = \boxplus X_i$,
where the sum is over equivalence classes of simples,
would result in a multifusion $C = \cC(X,X)$.

\pause
We can also avoid the first step of taking only one component
of $\cC$,

$C = \Vect_{G}$ for a finite group $G$.

\pause
$e$: trivial algebra $\kk_e$
\;\;\;
$\amod{e}(C) \simeq C_C$
\\
\pause
$f$: the group algebra $\kk[G] = \bigoplus \kk_g$
\;\;\;
$\amod{f}(C) \simeq \Vect$\\
(right action on $\Vect$ = forget $G$-grading)

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example}

Next we study the functor categories.
Clearly the $C$-endofunctors of $C_C$ is $C$ itself.
\\
\pause
For $\amod{f}(C)$,
an endofunctor is given by some $m \in \bimod{f}{f}(C)$;
write $m = \bigoplus m_g$.
\pause
The right $f$-action on $m$ makes all the $m_g$ isomorphic
in a coherent manner.
\pause
For $h \in G$, conjugation (left action by $h$ and right action
by $h^\inv$) gives an action of $G$ on $m_e$;
determines $m$ completely.

\pause
Thus, $\ModA{C}(f,f) \simeq \bimod{f}{f}(C) \simeq \Rep(G)$.

\pause

(Alternatively, one can also check that $C$-module structure on
$m: \Vect \to \Vect$
amounts to $G$-action on $m(\kk)$.)
\pause

Thus we have:
\[
\ModA{\Vect_G} \simeq \ModA{\Rep(G)}
\]

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example}

For functor categories between them, we see that
\[
\ModA{C}(e,f) \simeq \bimod{f}{e}(C) \simeq \amod{f}(C)
\simeq \Vect
\]
\[
\ModA{C}(f,e) \simeq \bimod{e}{f}(C) \simeq \moda{f}(C)
\simeq \Vect
\]

\pause
Note for $G = \ZZ/2$,
$\Vect_{\ZZ/2} \simeq \Rep(\ZZ/2)$,
don't see difference in endomorphism categories.

\pause
Of course, there are many other objects in $\ModA{C}$,
e.g. for a subgroup $H \subseteq G$,
have group algebra $\kk[H]$.
%which we denote by $h$ as an object in $C$.
%The category of modules $\amod{h}(C)$
%is simply the direct sum $\bigoplus_{H \backslash G} \Vect$,
%as the components $m_g$ of an $h$-module
%must be the same within each $H$-orbit.
%The endomorphism category seems a lot more complicated.
