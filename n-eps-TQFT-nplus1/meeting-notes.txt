continued discussion of skein categories
-Salvatore-Wahl Framed disc operads equivariant recognition principle
-framing of D2 important for monoidal structure
-E2-algebra
-tangent: spin/framed disk operads?

Street Formal Theory of Monads

Z(Ann) = Kleisli of Z(D2) (with central monad)
..or is it?
-got stuck on defining Kleisli -> Z(Ann) on morphisms
(when not semisimple, the coend is wrong way)
-maybe it's coKleisli, using the fact that under some conditions,
coend can be end [Fuchs,Schaumann,Fuchs - ... S4 Radford]
	-identification of end with coend is the source of d_i's
		in the sum in Kirby coloring in the semisimple case
-another way is if want coKleisli, namely if want morphisms A ---> B
	to be TA -> B,
	then want the left adjoint in the Kleisli adjunction
	to also be a right adjoint, so called "Frobenius"
	(another sense of Frobenius: left/right preserve alg/coalg objects,
	and 1 (unit) is both alg and coalg, so if left/right adjoint
	are same, then the image of 1 is Frobenius too..)
	so then T is now a comonad,
	and can define coKleisli

	Z(C) -> C is exact, so has left and right adjoints
	the adjoints are isomorphic, so get Radford S4?

	Nakayama functor N(X) = D.X** = **X.D (some signs missing),
	and the equivalence is Radford S4

-also should look at BenZvi-Brochier-Jordan, and Cooke

===================================================================

30.11.2022
-Ingo not present
-discussed the main excision lemma
	(hom in Z(N') is the coend of homs in Z(N),
	where N' is obtained from N by gluing two boundary parts)
-fix boundary values V,V' in N
-write hom(A,A') for hom_N(AV,V'A'),
-write hom' for hom_N'(i(V),i(V'))
-have maps hom(A,A') -> hom'
-respect the coend stuff, get int(hom(A,A)) -> hom'
-need to show is isom
-surjectivity easy
-injectivity etc


===================================================================

14.12.2022
-started with my attempts at generalizing hTr(M) = T(M)? = Z(M),
	but already done probably in
	Fuchs-Schaumann-Schweigert: trace of bimodule
-mentioned in non pivotal case, can consider 2-framed surfaces,
	then annulus can be n-twisted, get twisted Drinfeld center
	(half-braidings are Z.X -> X.D^n(Z), where D is double dual
	(Schommer-Pries?)
-Moved to discussion of David Reutter's slides
-presented my understanding of the slides,
	-from (n+eps)-TQFT to (n+1)-TQFT
	-a bit of confusion: at (n+eps) level, are those functors required
	to be adjoint - if so, then the 2-morphisms are data?
	-discussed up to making claim that counit for k determines
	unit for k+1 (ran out of time)
-Christoph slight confusion on Skein(S3) = {modified traces},
	because there is special modified trace associated to
	projective ideal which is built from the Nakayama functor
	- perhaps it means something for the resulting TQFT
-finite MTC has unique modified trace
-Cob_3,2,1 in terms of generators and relations (someone's paper)
-what if consider an arbitrary tensor ideal?
	note to self: proj ideal is smallest, so Proj in I in C

for next time:
	-study what these adjunctions mean for CY
		(build up CY from stringnets 3+eps)
	-figure out if adjointness is already required for a 3+eps
		or adjointness should only appear in 3+1
	-write up clearly the skein excision argument

===================================================================

11.01.2023
-discussed dual handles - in context of extended cobordism
	(e.g. Cob(4,3,2)), for handle as 1-morphism (e.g. 3d k-handle)
	the dual handle is the adjoint 1-morphism
	('dual' in dual handle is "not just poetry")
-I made claim that there are no obstructions to extending
	(n+eps) to (n+1)-TQFT,
	but probably wrong;
	Chirstoph suggests that it may have something to do with this:
	Duality in Monoidal Categories - Sebastian Halbig, Tony Zorman
	basically adjoints and snake relations are not enough for TQFT,
	need a stronger form of duality
	(my glancing impression is that (co)units must respect monoidal too)
-considered (1+eps) to gain intuition of the adjoint stuff
	considered (1+eps) theory where point assigned *//A
	(cat with one point, End(*) = A)
	(some completion of *//A gives A-mod,
	in some cases this completion is Karoubi completion,
	but this is more general)
	1-morphisms would be bimodules over A or A^op etc

for next time:
	-work out the *//A stuff? probably can consult literature
	-read the Duality in Monoidal Categories paper (it's short!)

===================================================================

19.01.2023
-started with Schommer-Pries (0,1,2)-theory = symm Frob
	some topology stuff, generators relations
-then started describing my attempts to approach it from
	the perspective of starting with (1+eps) and completing to (1+1)
	-went on long detour through "skein/stringnets" on 0,1 manifolds..
	-Z(pt+) = *//A, Z(pt-) = *//Aop
	-Z(interval) = graphs with vertices labeled with elem of A / relations
	-naturally get A vs Aop
	-etc
-insight that needing some 1-morphisms to be two-sided adjoints
	is important

for next time/hausaufgabe:
	-type/write up Ingo's notes on today's discussion
	-continue to understand the 1-morphisms being two-sided adjoints

===================================================================

27.01.2023
-start with skein theory for 1+eps
	-mentioned issue of whether to allow empty boundary value
	-Christoph: makes sense that in this case, must have object
	-in 2+eps, on 1-mflds, for the more general input data of bicat,
		a boundary value is not just points with labels,
		but the edges between them also get labels,
		more specifically, the points divide the 1-mfld into edges,
		to each edge assign object of bicat, and
		to each point assign 1-morphism
		-think of delooping BC for fusion C
		so even if there's no points, there should be a label of an
		object on the 1-mfld..
	-talked about profunctors, tasked me to learn more:

(1) Understand profunctors better
	-set-version, then what needs to change for vect-enriched
	-what is the correct notion of product of categories?
	F:A1 -> A2 ====> F* : A1^op x* A2 -> Vec, what is x*?
	-what conditions on categories? e.g. need coend to exist?
	(need composition of profunctors to make sense)

(2) change of coefficients ==> map between theories ==> what does it do to Z(S1)?
		(generalization of A/[A,A] = B/[B,B] for Morita equiv A,B
	-is there a non-trivial Dehn twist 2-morphism? (Map(S1) ~ S1, but is connected..)

(3) what conditions on A (the algebra) to get (1+eps)? (1+1)?
	-e.g. frob? finite? interesting case - A-mod is locally finite but not finite

===================================================================

composition uses coend "because" id as Hom(-,-) is identity
if use coend, not for end

Hausaufgabe
(1) clarify empty manifold, empty skein?
(2) skeins under diffeo
(3) what conditions does Skein construction place on A
	when we take *//A as input category? A finite dim? k can be ring?
(4) think of cusps as mapping cylinders?
	also see Juhasz Defining and Classifying TQFTs via Surgery
future: matrix factorization in skeins? see Nils
===================================================================

09.02.2023

the presense of cusp is felt by the 2-isomorphism
that relates compositions of 1-morphism:
Z(fg) ~ Z(f)Z(g)
