\title{Upgrading an $(n+\veps)$-TQFT to an extended $(n+1)$-TQFT}
\author{Ying Hong Tham}
\date{25 December, 2022}
\maketitle


In this note, we show that one can promote an
$(n+\veps)$-TQFT to an extended $(n+1)$-TQFT
by only specifying the value associated to
the $(n+1)$-disk $Z(\disk{n+1}) \in Z(S^n)$.

Suppose we are given an $(n+\veps)$-TQFT $Z$,
that is,
it assigns a category $Z(N)$ to a closed $(n-1)$-manifold $N$,
and a functor $Z(M):Z(N) \to Z(N')$ to an $n$-dimensional
cobordisms $M:N\to N'$ between $(n-1)$-manifolds.

TODO perhaps comment on requirements on $Z$,
e.g. a natural isom for $M \simeq M'$,
especially for $Z(M' \circ M) \simeq Z(M') \circ Z(M)$
that is consistent.
Or say, at this point, no assumption on existence of
adjointness of functors $Z(M) \dashv Z(\ov{M})$.

The empty $k$-manifold is denoted by $\empt{k}$.
Composition of cobordisms is written from right to left,
so composition of $M: N \to N'$ and $M' : N' \to N''$
is denoted by $M' \circ M: N \to N''$.

2-Cob denotes the bicategory with
closed $(n-1)$-manifolds as objects,
$n$-dimensional cobordisms as 1-morphisms,
and $(n+1)$-dimensional relative cobordisms as 2-morphisms.

\begin{proposition}
\label{p:extend-uniqueness}
Consider functors
$Z(\disk{n}) : Z(\empt{n-1}) \rightleftharpoons
	Z(\sphr{n-1}) : Z(\ov{\disk{n}})$.

Let $\eta_0: Z(\empt{n}) \Rightarrow
	Z(\sphr{n} = \ov{\disk{n}} \circ \disk{n})
	: Z(\empt{n-1}) \to Z(\empt{n-1})$
be a natural transformation,
and suppose it is the unit to an adjunction
$Z(\disk{n}) \dashv Z(\ov{\disk{n}})$.

Then if $Z',Z''$ are extended $(n+1)$-TQFTs
such that $Z',Z''$ agree with $Z$ on $(n-1)$- and $n$-manifolds,
and $Z'(\disk{n+1}) = Z''(\disk{n+1}) = \eta_0$,
then $Z' \cong Z''$.
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
From the topology section below,
we know that a 2-morphism of 2-Cob that realizes
the attachment of an $(n+1)$-dim $(k+1)$-handle,$0 \leq k \leq n$,
is determined by some counit $\veps_k$
of an adjunction,
whose corresponding unit can be built from handles
of index at most $k$,
and thus, the value of extensions $Z'$ of $Z$ on 2-morphisms
is completely determined by its value on the
$(n+1)$-dim 0-handle, which is exactly $\eta_0$.
\end{proof}



\section{Topology}

\subsection{Adjunctions from topology}
\label{s:topology-adjunctions}

For the purposes of the proof of the proposition above,
only the first simple example from this section is needed,
the reader may then skip to \secref{s:handles-from-adjunctions}.

In 2-Cob,
%In the 2-category with closed $(n-1)$-manifolds as objects,
%$n$-dimensional cobordisms as 1-morphisms,
%and $(n+1)$-dimensional relative cobordisms as 2-morphisms,
the $n$-dimensional cobordisms
$M: N \rightleftharpoons N' : \ov{M}$
form an adjunction.

Let us first consider a simple case,
which is the main setting in \prpref{p:extend-uniqueness}.
Consider $n$-dim cobordisms
$\disk{n}: \empt{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1}: \ov{\disk{n}}$.
This can be promoted to an adjunction
$\disk{n} \dashv \ov{\disk{n}}$
with the following unit and counit 2-morphisms:
the unit is given by the $(n+1)$-disk
$\disk{n+1}: \empt{n} \Rightarrow
	(\ov{\disk{n}} \circ \disk{n}) = \sphr{n}$,
and the counit is given by the $(n+1)$-disk which,
as a manifold with corner $\sphr{0} \times \sphr{n-1}$,
is a 2-morphism
$\disk{n+1} = I \times \disk{n}: \disk{n} \circ \ov{\disk{n}}
	\Rightarrow I \times \sphr{n-1} = \id_{\sphr{n-1}}$.
This is easily checked to be an adjunction,
the unit is an $(n+1)$-dimensional 0-handle,
and the counit is attaching an $(n+1)$-dimensional 1-handle
to $\disk{n} \sqcup \ov{\disk{n}}$
(see \figref{f:disk-adjunction} for $n=1$ case).

relative cobordism goes up
(stolen from \cite{SPries},

\label{f:disk-adjunction}
\end{figure}


Now consider $M: N \rightleftharpoons N': \ov{M}$,
where $M$ is an elementary cobordism of index $k$,
i.e. it is obtained from $N \times I$
by attaching a $k$-handle.
Then $\ov{M}$ is the dual elementary cobordism
which is of index $n-k$.
[See \figref{f:dual-handle}]

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{diagram-dual-handle.jpg}
\caption{$M:N \to N'$ is an elementary cobordism
of index $k$; it is built from attaching a disk $\disk{n}$
to $N \times I$,
with attaching region $\del \disk{k} \times \disk{n-k}$.
It can also be built from the other direction,
by attaching a disk $\disk{n}$
to $N' \times I$,
with attaching region $\disk{k} \times \del \disk{n-k}$.
Thus, turning it upside-down, i.e.
treated as a cobordism $\ov{M}: N' \to N$,
it is an elementary cobordism of index $(n-k)$.
}
\label{f:dual-handle}
\end{figure}

[See \figref{f:elementary-cobord-counit-unit}]
We construct the counit
$\veps: M \circ \ov{M} \Rightarrow \id_{N'} : N' \to N'$
by attaching an
$(n+1)$-dimensional $(k+1)$-handle to $M \cup_{N'} \ov{M}$,
with attaching region being essentially the
$k$-handle in $M$ plus the $(n-k)$-handle in $\ov{M}$;
the attaching sphere is the union of the core of the
$k$-handle in $M$
with the co-core of the $(n-k)$-handle in $\ov{M}$.
Similarly,
we construct the unit
$\eta: \id_N \Rightarrow M \circ \ov{M} : N \to N$
by attaching an
$(n+1)$-dimensional $k$-handle to $\id_N = N \times I$;
the attaching region for this $(n+1)$-dim $k$-handle
is
$($the attaching region for the $n$-dim $k$-handle that defines
$M) \times I$.
The snake equations
$\id_M = (\veps \circ M) \cdot (M \circ \eta):
M \Rightarrow M \circ \ov{M} \circ M \Rightarrow M$
and
$\id_{\ov{M}} = (\ov{M} \circ \eta) \cdot (\eta \circ \ov{M}):
\ov{M} \Rightarrow \ov{M} \circ M \circ \ov{M} \Rightarrow \ov{M}$
follow from the fact that
these $(n+1)$-dim handles form a cancelling pair
in both cases.

Here we have $M \dashv \ov{M}$,
but we may very well have $\ov{M} \dashv M$;
the counit $\veps': \ov{M} \circ M \Rightarrow \id_N$
is an $(n+1)$-dim elementary cobordism
of index $(n-k+1)$.
It is interesting to note that
this counit is the dual cobordism to the unit
$\eta: \id_N \Rightarrow \ov{M} \circ M$
previously described.

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{diagram-counit-unit-elementary-cobord.jpg}
\caption{Counit (top) and unit (bottom) for adjunction
$M: N \rightleftharpoons N': \ov{M}$,
where $M$ is an elementary cobordism of index $k$.
Note the way $N$ is drawn here looks like $N'$
in \figref{f:dual-handle} and vice versa
(by accident, sorry for minor confusion)}
\label{f:elementary-cobord-counit-unit}
\end{figure}



In general, we may consider the pair of $n$-dim cobordisms
$M : N \rightleftharpoons N': \ov{M}$.
By presenting $M$ as a composition of elementary cobordisms,
we may compose the adjunctions constructed
for each of these elementary cobordisms as above,
and obtain an adjunction $M \dashv \ov{M}$.



\begin{remark}
In \cite{Yprod},
we considered this construction
without realizing their connection to these adjunctions;
there we consider the more general case where
$N,N'$ may have (possibly different) boundary, and
$M: N \to N'$ is a relative cobordism
(with the boundary cobordism that is
not necessarily the identity cobordism).
\end{remark}


\subsection{Producing $(n+1)$-dim $k$-handles
from some adjunctions}
\label{s:handles-from-adjunctions}

Throughout this section, $0 \leq k < n$.

We show how to construct the $(n+1)$-dim $(k+1)$-handle
from the counit $\veps_k$ of the adjunction
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} : \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$
and the unit $\eta_0$ of the adjunction
$\disk{n} : \empt{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1}: \ov{\disk{n}}$.
(The 0-handle is already given by $\eta_0$,
while the $(n+1)$-handle is the counit to the adjunction
$\ov{\disk{n}} : \sphr{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\empt{n-1}: \disk{n}$;
we say a few more words about this at the end of this section.)


The process of attaching a $(k+1)$-handle to an $(n+1)$-manifold
can be implemented as postcomposing by a 2-morphism.
More precisely, given an $(n+1)$-manifold $W$
presented as a 2-morphism $W: M \Rightarrow M' : N \to N'$,
and an attaching region $\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}$ in $M'$,
the $(n+1)$-manifold $W'$ obtained from
attaching a $(k+1)$-handle along the specified attaching region
may be considered as a 2-morphism
$W': M \Rightarrow M'': N \to N'$,
where $M''$ is obtain from $M'$ by performing surgery
along the attaching region
(cutting it out and gluing in $\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$);
then $W' = \omega_{k+1} \cdot W$,
where $\omega_{k+1}$ is a 2-morphism that we will describe below.


Our 2-morphism $\omega_{k+1}$ is of the form
$\omega_{k+1}: \sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}
	\Rightarrow \disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1} :
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} \to \empt{n-1}$.
Since this is unchanged as $W$ varies,
we clearly need to make some arrangements
in order to use $\omega_{k+1}$.
More specifically,
we need to present $M'$ as a composition
\[
(\id_{N'} \sqcup \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}})
\circ (M \backslash \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}) :
N \to N' \sqcup \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k+1} \to N'
\]
which is always possible by basic Morse theory.
So we have
($M^\circ := M \backslash \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$):

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (-2,0) {$W' = $};
% objects
\node (a) at (0,0) {$N$};
\node (b) at (4,0) {$N' \sqcup \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k+1}$};
\node (c) at (8,0) {$N' \sqcup \empt{n-1}$};
% 1-morph
\draw[->] (a) -- (b)
	node[pos=0.5,below] {\footnotesize $M^\circ$};
\draw[->] (b) -- (c)
	node[pos=0.5,below]
	{\footnotesize $\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$};
\draw[->] (b) .. controls +(-60:2cm) and +(-120:2cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,below]
	{\footnotesize $\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}$};
\draw[->] (a) .. controls +(60:3cm) and +(120:3cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $M$};
\draw[->] (a) .. controls +(30:2cm) and +(150:2cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $M'$};
% 2-morph
\draw[-{Implies},double] (4,0.6) -- (4,0.3)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\simeq$};
\draw[-{Implies},double] (6,-0.6) -- (6,-1.2)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\omega_{k+1}$};
\end{tikzpicture}


Now let us describe how to construct $\omega_{k+1}$
out of $\veps_k$ and $\eta_0$,
which are, as a reminder,
the counit and unit of the adjunctions
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} : \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$
and
$\disk{n} : \empt{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1}: \ov{\disk{n}}$,
respectively.

We may consider $\sphr{n}: \empt{n-1} \to \empt{n-1}$
as the composition $\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}
\circ \sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} :
\empt{n-1} \to \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} \to \empt{n-1}$.

Then $\omega_{k+1}$ is given by the composition of 2-morphisms
\[
\omega_{k+1} = (\id_{\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}}
		\circ \veps_k)
	\cdot (\id_{\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}} \circ \eta_0)
\]

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (-2,0) {$\omega_{k+1} = $};
% objects
\node (a) at (0,0) {$\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$};
\node (b) at (4,0) {$\empt{n-1}$};
\node (c) at (8,0) {$\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$};
\node (d) at (12,0) {$\empt{n-1}$};
% 1-morph
\draw[->] (a) -- (b)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$};
\draw[->] (b) -- (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}$};
\draw[->] (c) -- (d)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\ov{\disk{k+1} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}$};
\draw[->] (b) .. controls +(60:3cm) and +(120:3cm) .. (d)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\empt{n}$};
\draw[->] (a) .. controls +(-60:3cm) and +(-120:3cm) .. (c)
	node[pos=0.5,above] {\footnotesize $\id_{\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}}$};
% 2-morph
\draw[-{Implies},double] (8,1.6) -- (8,0.5)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\eta_0$};
\draw[-{Implies},double] (4,-0.5) -- (4,-1.4)
	node[pos=0.5,right] {\footnotesize $\veps_k$};
\end{tikzpicture}


A few words on the $(n+1)$-handle,
more generally the adjunction
$\ov{\disk{n}} : \sphr{n-1} \rightleftharpoons
	\empt{n-1}: \disk{n}$.
The unit is a 2-morphism
$\eta: \id_{\sphr{n-1}} \Rightarrow \disk{n} \circ \ov{\disk{n}}$,
which is clearly an elementary cobordism of index $n$.

A similar phenomenon happens with $\veps_k$,
that is, $\eta_k$, the unit to the adjunction
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} \dashv
	\ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$,
to which $\veps_k$ is the counit,
is determined by handles of index at most $k$,
and indeed,
$\eta_k = \sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k+1}:
\empt{n} \Rightarrow \sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k}:
\empt{n-1} \to \empt{n-1}$
is built from a 0-handle and a $k$-handle.


Thus, since the counit is uniquely determined by the unit,
the $(n+1)$-dim $k$-handle, for $k > 0$,
is determined by handles of lower index.
This may not be very useful in the topology world,
but on the algebraic side of a TQFT,
this means that everything is determined by the 0-handle.



[It may be helpful to note that the adjunction
$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1} : \ov{\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k}}$
is simply $\sphr{k}$ times
the first example but with $n$ set to $n-k$,
$\disk{n-k} : \empt{n-k} \rightleftharpoons
	\sphr{n-1-k}: \ov{\disk{n-k}}$.
]


Note $\veps_k$ is not just a $k$-handle,
but may use lower $k$;
e.g. for $n = 3, k = 1$,
$\veps_k: \ov{S^1 \times D^2} \sqcup S^1 \times D^2 \Rightarrow
S^1 \times S^1 \times I$
uses one 1-handle (connecting the solid tori)
then a 2-handle.

%(Note that one can study the adjunction
%e.g. by considering the handle decomposition for
%$\sphr{k} \times \disk{n-k} : \empt{n} \to
%	\sphr{k} \times \sphr{n-k-1}$
%is given by a 0-handle followed by a $k$-handle,
%but this is 


\section{Skein theory for $(1+\veps)$-theory}

To study completion of a $(n+\veps)$-theory
to an extended $(n+1)$-theory,
we start by studying the simplest case, $n = 1$.

In particular, we will study the $(1+\veps)$-theory
arising from skeins in 1-manifolds.

Manifolds with be assumed to be compact
unless otherwise specified.

We consider oriented 0-manifolds,
denoted by tuples of signs, e.g. $(+,+,-,+)$;
the empty 0-manifold is denoted by $()$ or $\empt{0}$.
Note that the tuple is ordered, but the 0-manifold itself
is not, in the sense that
$(+,+,-,+)$ is homeomorphic to $(-,+,+,+)$;
it is useful to keep an ordering of the points
to keep our heads straight on the algebra.

Sometimes we will denote a singleton by simply $+$,
or $-$, or $pt^+$, or $pt^-$.

Let us fix a $\kk$-linear category $\cA$.
We will often consider the special case of
$\cA = *//A$, where $A$ is a $\kk$-algebra.

Let us first describe the objects of the category
$Z(N)$ for an oriented 0-manifold $N$,
so-called boundary values:

\begin{definition}
A \emph{boundary value} $\VV$ on an oriented 0-manifold $N$
is an assignment of an object $V_b \in \cA$
for every point $b \in N$.

We denote by $\ov{\VV}$ the boundary value on $\ov{N}$
(opposite orientation) with the same assignments as $\VV$.
\end{definition}

Note that usually (for $\dim N = 1,2$)
a boundary value is a finite set of points in $N$
with assigned objects;
here we require the finite set of points of a boundary value
to be all of $N$ because:
(1) if $\cA$ has structure, e.g. rigid monoidal,
we may as well assign the unit object $\one$ to points
of $N$ that are not in the boundary value;
(2) if $\cA$ is simply only $\kk$-linear,
say $\cA = A-\text{mod}$,
we can still consider skeins as we will see below,
but if we do not assign an object to a boundary point,
it is unclear what such a skein should do at the boundary...


Next we define skeins in a 1-manifold.
Let $M$ be an oriented 1-manifold.
Its boundary, $\del M$, acquires an orientation from $M$,
with a point $b \in \del M$ being $pt^+$ if $M$
is outwardly-oriented at $b$, and $pt^-$ otherwise.

\begin{definition}
\label{d:A-colored-graph}
Let $M$ be an oriented 1-manifold.
Let $\VV$ be a boundary value on $\del M$.
An $\cA$-colored graph $(\Gamma,\vphi)$
is an embedded oriented graph $\Gamma$ in $M$,
with edge oriented in accordance with $M$
and is surjective on $M$,
and $\vphi$ is an assignment of an object $\vphi_e$
for each edge $e$ of $\Gamma$
such that the assignment to the edges meeting the boundary
agrees with the boundary value $\VV$,
and a morphism $\vphi_v: \vphi_e \to \vphi_{e'}$
for every internal vertex of $\Gamma$
with an incoming edge $e$ and outgoing edge $e'$.
\end{definition}

Note finiteness of the graph is automatic.

We often denote an $\cA$-colored graph simply by $\Gamma$.

\begin{definition}
\label{d:local-ev}
Let $(\Gamma,\vphi)$ be an $\cA$-colored graph
in an oriented 1-manifold $M$.
Let $D$ be a 1-dimension embedded disk, i.e. an interval,
in $M$, such that $\del D$ does not meet any internal vertex
of $\Gamma$.
Let $X,X'$ be the objects assigned to the edges $e,e'$,
respectively, that contain or meet $\del D$,
with $e$ oriented into $D$, and $e'$ oriented out of $D$.
Let $e_0 = e, e_1,\ldots,e_k = e'$ be the edges
of $\Gamma$ that meet $D$, and let
$v_i$ be the vertex between $e_{i-1}$ and $e_i$.

We define the \emph{evaluation of $(\Gamma,\vphi)$ in $D$}
to be the composition
\[
\eval{(\Gamma,\vphi)}_D
= \vphi_{v_k} \circ \cdots \circ \vphi_{v_1}
\in \Hom_\cA(X,X')
\]
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
\label{d:null-graph}
Let $\Gamma_1,\ldots,\Gamma_k$ be $\cA$-colored graphs in $M$
with boundary value $\VV$,
and let $c_1,\ldots,c_k \in \kk$.
Let $D$ be a 1-disk in $M$.
We say that the formal $\kk$-linear combination
$\sum c_i \cdot \Gamma_i$ is
\emph{null (with respect to $D$)}
if $\Gamma_i$ agree outside of $D$,
and $\sum c_i \eval{\Gamma_i}_D = 0$.
\end{definition}

Note that $c \cdot \Gamma - c\Gamma$ is null,
where $c\Gamma$ is the $\cA$-colored graph
where one of the morphisms in $\Gamma$ is scaled by $c$.

\begin{definition}
\label{d:skein}
The \emph{skein module} $\Skein(M;\VV)$
of $M$ with boundary value $\VV$
is the space of formal linear combinations of
$\cA$-colored graphs in $M$ with boundary value $\VV$
module null graphs.
A \emph{skein} is an element of a skein module.
\end{definition}


Finally, we can give the full definition of the category
$Z(N)$:

\begin{definition}
\label{d:skein-category}
The \emph{skein category} $Z(N)$ associated to an
oriented 0-manifold $N$
is the category whose objects are boundary values $\VV$,
and morphism are given by
\[
\Hom_{Z(N)}(\VV,\VV') = \Skein(N \times I; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV')
\]
\end{definition}

It is straightforward to check that
$Z(pt^+) \simeq \cA$
and $Z(pt^-) \simeq \cA^\opp$
(in fact these are isomorphisms).

\begin{definition}
For $\kk$-linear categories $\cB,\cC$,
we define the category $\cB \hatbox \cC$
as the additive completion of the category
whose objects are pairs of objects $B_i,C_i$ from $\cB,\cC$,
denoted $B_i \hatbox C_i$,
and morphisms are
\[
\Hom(B_i \hatbox C_i, B_j \hatbox C_j)
:=
\Hom_\cB(B_i, B_j) \tnsr \Hom_\cC(C_i, C_j)
\]
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
$Z(N_1 \sqcup N_2) \simeq Z(N_1) \hatbox Z(N_2)$
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
For a cobordism $M : N \to N'$,
we define the profunctor
$Z(M): Z(N) \nrightarrow Z(N')$
defined by
\[
(\VV, \VV') \mapsto \Skein(M; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV')
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{p:1-cobord-compose}
For cobordisms $M: N \to N', M': N' \to N''$,
$Z(M' \circ M) \simeq Z(M') \circ Z(M)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We need to show that, for boundary values
$\VV,\VV''$ on $N,N''$ respectively,
\[
\int^{\VV'} \Skein(M';\ov{\VV'} \cup \VV'')
\tnsr \Skein(M; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV')
\simeq \Skein(M' \circ M; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV'')
\]
The obvious concatenation of graphs
in $M,M'$ to form a graph in $M' \circ M$
gives a map
$\Phi_{\VV'}: \Skein(M';\ov{\VV'} \cup \VV'')
\tnsr \Skein(M; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV')
\to \Skein(M' \circ M; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV'')$
for each $\VV'$.
It is easy to see that the sum of these maps,
$\sum_{\VV'} \Phi_{\VV'}:
\bigoplus_{\VV'} \Skein(M';\ov{\VV'} \cup \VV'')
\tnsr \Skein(M; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV')
\to \Skein(M' \circ M; \ov{\VV} \cup \VV'')$,
factors through the coend.

That this map is surjective is obvious;
for injectivity, see notes on excision
(or see \cite{KT}).
\end{proof}
